In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

I used AI to help me conceptually understand what a DFA is. I also used
it to help me translate from a diagram DFA into a text DFA. I also used
it to help with debugging my code, where I would give it a specific
file that I was not getting correct and ask it why my code may not be
working. Lastly, I used it to help me create a copy of my repo on 
armlab. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I think it was helpful and helped me understand DFAs and writing C code
in general better.
